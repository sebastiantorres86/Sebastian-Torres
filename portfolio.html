  This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to the design provided. I used HTML5, along with CSS
  Grid and JavaScript for the areas that required interactivity, such as the features section.

  Project Background

  This project was a front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. It's a platform that enables you to practice building
  websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the websites
  should look at different screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine myh workflow and solve real-world
  coding problems. I've learned something new with each prject, helping me to improve and adapt my style.
